# 🌿 BreakLo — Burnout Early Warning System

> **Helping people catch burnout before burnout catches them.**

BreakLo is a behavior-based burnout early-warning system designed to detect rising strain and recovery imbalance **before performance or mental health collapses**.

Instead of reacting after burnout happens, BreakLo helps users recognize imbalance early and take small recovery actions that keep work and well-being in balance.

## 🎯 Problem We Solve

Burnout doesn’t happen suddenly.  
It builds quietly through:

- Long work hours
- Poor recovery
- Irregular breaks
- Reduced sleep

Most tools track productivity or fitness, but **no system warns users early**.

BreakLo fills this gap.

## 💡 Solution Overview

BreakLo analyzes daily behavior patterns and shows users:

- BreakLo functions as an **early-warning system for burnout**, identifying rising strain before it becomes a mental or performance crisis.

- The solution analyzes everyday behavioral signals such as **work duration, break patterns, and sleep recovery** to measure whether recovery is keeping pace with workload.

- Instead of overwhelming users with complex metrics, BreakLo converts behavioral data into **clear visual insights and intuitive recovery zones**, making personal well-being instantly understandable.

- Through an interactive **What-If Simulator**, users can test small improvements and immediately see how minor lifestyle changes can reduce burnout risk.

- The platform emphasizes **prevention over diagnosis**, helping users make smarter daily decisions before exhaustion becomes irreversible.

- BreakLo ultimately transforms burnout awareness into **actionable recovery guidance**, enabling individuals to sustain productivity while protecting long-term well-being.

Users can also simulate improvements and instantly see their impact.
